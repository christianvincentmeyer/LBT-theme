Most thrills per mile of any route and stops at all the same landmarks. Includes up to 8 trails in Beebe Hill and Harvey Mtn state forests. <br/></li><li>Gravel Only - Longer - 56 miles, 6000ft climbing. 2 aid stations, zero mountain bike trails, and way more than a vertical mile of climbing.<br/></li><li>Chonky Mtn Bike Trails - Longer - 61 miles, 6500ft climbing. 2 aid stations and includes up to 8 trails in Beebe Hill and Harvey Mtn state forests. The biggest challenge of them all!</li></ul><h3>Bike and Tire Choice: </h3><p>The mountain bike trails are optional, and so are the suspension forks. Every route has enough miles and climbing to make you regret bringing your trail bike, but there's enough chonk on the mtb routes to outmatch your gravel bike. Rigid and hardtail mountain bikes were popular last year.  When you're considering which bike to bring to Beebe & Beyond, bring your klunker, your lugged steel pedaller, your Velo Orange Neutrino, your Santa Cruz Stigmata, that one bike with the lefty front fork, or whatever feels right that day. </p><p>Just please carry your own equipment to fix your tire if it goes flat. If you choose one of the chonky routes then we recommend tires around 2 inches (50mm) in width. Gravel-only routes have a mix of hard packed smooth gravel and loose, rough stone so we recommend tires around 40mm in width.</p>"
