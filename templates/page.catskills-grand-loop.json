You can choose to start at any point, but most start near the town of Cairo (\"Kay-ro\"), NY because it's a good spot for multi-night vehicle parking. </p><h3>Riding Season: </h3><ul><li>Spring: limited to the approximately 3 weeks after the ice melts and before the black flies come out in May. </li><li>Late June to mid-October is the best riding window. </li></ul><h3>Services Along the Route: </h3><p>There are no bike shops along the route. Phone service is spotty, but occasionally you will have phone service while riding in the forests, and usually while you are in town. Riders can charge electrical devices and use wifi while patronizing local businesses. There is a shower stop and wifi at the <a href=\"https://www.catskillrecreationcenter.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.catskillrecreationcenter.org/\">Catskill Recreation Center</a> in Arkville, NY, where a day pass costs $20.</p><h3>Train Accessibility: </h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://ridewithgps.com/routes/53156378\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://ridewithgps.com/routes/53156378\">20 miles from the Amtrak station in Hudson, NY</a>.

Brings you past several local bike shops and many opportunities to supply food. Can go the flat way around Shawangunk ridge, or the extra-scenic way over the ridge.</li></ul><h3>Vehicle Parking: </h3><p>Cairo, NY is the best location to leave your vehicle while you are riding, and the exact location is marked on the RideWithGPS page. It is a camera-monitored parking lot by the local police department. Don't park where it's paved, only where it's gravel. There is no fee, and the town is fine with vehicles parked here for 1-6 nights. On the day you are leaving your vehicle, the local police department asks that you call and leave a voice message for Sergeant Busch detailing which car will be parked there and for approximately how long. Call Sergeant Busch at 518-622-2324. Local PD also recommends that people leaving their vehicle include written identifying information, such as a name and phone number or emergency contact, on the front seat or dashboard, in case of an emergency.</p><p>The towns of Livingston Manor (on the route) and Margaretville (very close to the route) each have off-street municipal parking lots where overnight parking is allowed but not monitored.</p><p>For parking at DEC trailheads: vehicles can stay overnight and if you plan to leave your vehicle, call the ranger listed on the signage and leave a voicemail describing your vehicle and how long it will be there. Sleeping in your car overnight is not permitted, not even for a single night, and rangers do check on this. </p>"

            "text": "<h3>Cycling Surfaces:</h3><p>We avoid all traffic-heavy, no-shoulder roads and 55mph highways. Instead, we traverse mountain passes and rural valleys on paved roads and a total of 35 miles of rocky snowmobile trails, doubletrack paths, unpaved dirt and gravel roads, and occasional singletrack. By avoiding the big roads, we are choosing to ride further, higher, and closer to nature. Gravel is preferred to paved wherever possible and each road that’s included in the route is selected to maximize feelings of remoteness and scenic beauty.</p><h3>Bike and Tire Choice: </h3><p>A rigid frame bicycle is well-suited to this route (suspension fork not necessary). The variety of terrains on this route means you should have tires that can handle rough gravel and tree roots without being too knobby for the paved sections. Tires around 2 inches (50mm) in width will be great. You can ride this route on narrower tires and still enjoy yourself because of the overall percentage of paved road miles, but plan on occasionally hiking your bike.</p><h3>Brakes and Braking:</h3><p>It is essential that you test your brakes and demonstrate that your most forceful braking can stop you while descending a steep hill on a loaded bike. Be prepared for reduced braking power during wet conditions. It’s scary when you don’t have that braking power, the potential for injury increases, and the journey stops being fun. Facts:</p><ol><li>A bicycle loaded with camping equipment, water, and food requires more force to stop than an unloaded bike</li><li>Some of the downhill segments on Catskills Grand Loop are very steep</li><li>The Catskills are known to be rainy and foggy, and wet conditions increase braking distance</li></ol><h3>Camping: </h3><p> Catskills Grand Loop is made for primitive and dispersed camping, so campgrounds with full facilities are not included on the map. You need to familiarize yourself with <a href=\"https://lnt.org/why/7-principles/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://lnt.org/why/7-principles/\">the 7 Leave No Trace Principles</a> and act accordingly when you're camping in the forest preserve. </p><p>When choosing which type of shelter to use for this route, know that hammocks offer more flexibility in campsite selection, but you will be fine using a tent.  The campsites are a combination of: </p><ul><li>DEC-designated spots in the forest preserve that have lots of flat areas which are great for tents</li><li>Lean-tos with a pit latrine, a fire pit, and a water source nearby</li><li>State forests where only a bikepacker would camp (like some places in the Great Northern Catskills) </li></ul><p>Highlighted campsites are on public lands that permit primitive camping at least 150 feet from any road, trail, spring, stream, pond or other body of water, unless it’s an area designated by a lean-to shelter or a yellow “Camp Here” sign. A separate public authority, NYC Water Supply DEP, does not permit overnight camping on their heavily monitored lands, and this route reflects that. </p><ul><li>Please read more about <a href=\"https://dec.ny.gov/things-to-do/camping/state-land-rules\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://dec.ny.gov/things-to-do/camping/state-land-rules\">NY State details about primitive camping and campsite selection</a> </li><li>NYS DEC has<a href=\"https://extapps.dec.ny.gov/docs/lands_forests_pdf/catmapguide.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://extapps.dec.ny.gov/docs/lands_forests_pdf/catmapguide.pdf\"> a highly detailed map that delineates the complicated mix of private and public lands in the Catskills Preserve</a> </li></ul><p></p><h3>Lean-To Shelters:</h3><p>Some of these campsites have a lean-to shelter. What is a \"Lean-To\"? It's an open-faced shelter with a roof and three walls, usually about 10ft x 16ft. All of the lean-tos in the Catskills are log construction and there is a wooden floor.  </p><p>What's the point of a \"Lean-To\"? Lean-tos are for you and your fellow campers to socialize, dry and mend equipment, cook and eat. When you’re this far out in the woods, the lean-to is everyone’s kitchen, dining room, living room, and workbench. In general, everybody should be setting up their own tent or hammock in the vicinity of the lean-to but not inside it. It is not for individuals to claim as their personal sleeping area. The exception is that it’s ok if it’s very late in the day (when it's less likely that another person arrives). </p><p>If you ever wanted to volunteer to rehabilitate lean-to shelters in the Catskills, the <a href=\"https://www.nynjtc.org/what-we-do/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.nynjtc.org/what-we-do/\">NYNJTC</a> has <a href=\"https://www.nynjtc.org/catskills-lean-to-crew/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.nynjtc.org/catskills-lean-to-crew/\">a volunteer Lean-To Work Crew</a> with many fun weekend work trips with overnight camping. </p>"

Recommend carrying at least 2L of water capacity if you are using a filter. If not, you will pass through a town at least once a day, where you can buy gallon jugs of water, and you should plan to carry closer to 4L water capacity. During drought conditions, moving surface water is still common but not ubiquitous.</p><ul><li>From April to October, <a href=\"https://detteflies.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://detteflies.com/\">Dette Flies</a> fly fishing store (on the route in the town of Livingston Manor) has <a href=\"https://detteflies.com/pages/daily-fishing-report\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://detteflies.com/pages/daily-fishing-report\">Daily Fishing Reports</a> that give very specific descriptions of the Willowemoc and Beaverkill creeks that we ride past from approximately mile 75 to 105.  </li><li><a href=\"https://dec.ny.gov/environmental-protection/water/water-quantity/drought/current-drought-conditions\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://dec.ny.gov/environmental-protection/water/water-quantity/drought/current-drought-conditions\">NYS drought conditions</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/reservoir-levels.page#\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/reservoir-levels.page#\">NYC water reservoir levels</a> provide more info about drought conditions affecting the area.</li></ul><p></p><h3>Food & Meal Prep: </h3><p>Every 50 miles there is at least one significant town with a grocery store and other food options, so meal planning and resupplying are as simple as you want them to be. You could prep all your dried meals beforehand, or you can easily carry only snacks with you, and purchase prepared foods or groceries each day. Lots of details are in the RideWithGPS route.</p><h3>Bears and Animals: </h3><p>In comparison with big campgrounds, the campsites highlighted on this route are not constant sources of food for bears and other mammals. Let’s keep them this way. On this route you are more likely to encounter opportunistic mice and deer before you encounter a bear, but please know that black bears are present throughout the Catskills. Because of food smells, every night it’s important to take precautions which prevent smaller mammals from eating into your shelter, such as hanging your food from a tree branch sufficiently far away. A bear canister is not necessary but would be useful if you are in a small group and you all choose to consolidate your food into the canister. </p><h3>Geology & Ecology:</h3><p>The terrain of the Catskills is all crests and valleys. This region is defined by sedimentary rocks, steep ridgelines covered in forests, and wide open slightly sloped glacial floodplains covered in rich soil. The Catskill Mountains supported forest biomes a long time ago and they still do today. The oldest fossilized evidence of forests on our planet that we’ve uncovered so far (385,000,000ya) has been found at the foot of the Catskill Escarpment near the town of Cairo, NY. The town sits about 350ft above the Hudson River (sea level) and sits in the sunset shadow of the very prominent Great Northern Catskills, including Black Dome, Blackhead, Thomas Cole, and Windham Mountains, 4 of the 35 Catskill high peaks above 3500ft. </p><h3>Watersheds:</h3><p>You would be just as correct in referring to regions of the Catskill Mountains by their watershed as by their high peak names. These days most of the meandering streams flow into dammed-up NYC water supply reservoirs, and on this route you will see 3 of them (Ashokan, Rondout, Pepacton). The route almost touches 2 more (Neversink, Schoharie) but instead turns away and begins a climb up the least likely road. Flowing streams and natural springs are plentiful along the route, so by carrying filtration or purification equipment you will have no trouble refilling your water supply.</p>"
