This is a majority-paved route with segments of rough gravel and 4x4 roads, and riders have the option to add more gravel miles by exploring scenic unpaved dead-end roads. All camping on this route is on public lands at lean-tos and other dispersed campsites, and there are daily grocery resupply points. You would find this route a good fit if you are looking for a multi-day trip that’s physically demanding, not the biggest time commitment, and you want to experience the challenges of trail riding and Leave No Trace camping. It’s a really enjoyable route through one of the largest forest preserves in the Northeast."
