            "desc": "You would find this route a good fit if you are looking for a multi-day trip that’s physically demanding, not the biggest time commitment, and you want to experience the challenges of trail riding and Leave No Trace camping. Catskills Grand Loop is a complete clockwise loop. You can choose to start at any point, but most start near the town of Cairo (\"Kay-ro\"), NY because it's a good spot for multi-night vehicle parking. This bikepacking route is train-accessible and can also be reached by bicycle from the Empire State Trail in Hudson, Kingston, and New Paltz. On this route you will feel like you really roughed it with the camping, you'll be grateful those grocery stores were there, and hopefully feel like you got to participate in what makes the Catskill Mountains special.",
