From Hillsdale the Harlem Valley Rail Trail runs 25 miles to the MetroNorth regional rail of NYC, and over the border with MA and CT are the Berkshire Mountains and Litchfield Hills. Further North is the Rensselaer Plateau, which offers even more gravel and camping opportunities.<br\/><\/li><li><strong>To the South<\/strong> the Empire State Trail passes through tranquil, flat farmlands with rolling hills and Catskill Mountain vistas. <br\/><\/li><li><strong>North <\/strong>out of Hudson is the Albany-Hudson Electric Trail which is a 36 mile, mostly paved rail trail that takes you directly to Amtrak’s station in Rensselaer, NY (right across the river from Albany). <br\/><\/li><li><strong>To the West<\/strong> is the Rip van Winkle bridge which takes you directly to the foot of the Great Northern Catskills. 6 miles gets you to the Ramshorn-Livingston nature preserve for bird-watching. 20 miles from Hudson there’s plenty of mountain biking in Round Top, NY. 40 miles from Hudson puts you 2200ft up and directly in the heart of the northern Catskills between Windham and Prattsville. And in the summers there’s a river ferry from Hudson to Athens that you can bring your bike on.<br\/><\/li><\/ul>"
